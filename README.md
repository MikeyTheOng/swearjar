# SwearJar Web App

## Description

SwearJar is a web application designed to help users create and manage virtual "swear jars" for various purposes. Unlike traditional swear jars that focus solely on profanity, our app allows users to create jars for any habit or behavior they want to track or discourage.

## Key Features

1. **Customizable Jars**: Users can create virtual swear jars for any purpose, such as procrastination, unhealthy snacking, or actual swearing.

2. **User Invitations**: The app allows users to invite others to participate in their swear jars, fostering accountability and social interaction.

3. **Multiple Jars**: Users can maintain multiple swear jars simultaneously for different purposes.

4. **Tracking**: The app tracks contributions to each jar, helping users visualize their progress in changing habits.

5. **Collaborative Goal-Setting**: Invited users can participate in the same jar, creating a shared experience in habit-breaking or goal achievement.

## Purpose

The SwearJar web app aims to provide a fun, interactive, and flexible way for individuals and groups to track and modify behaviors, set goals, and hold each other accountable in a digitally connected world.
